         For quite some time I was wondering “How could I combine both of them?” Then it clicked! Working as a Senior Data Management Assistant at UNHCR made sense. So here I am, fulfilling my two passions by supporting the people that were forced to flee by using my experience in Informatics.">

                         seeks to explain the complex dynamics of queues, from how they form and evolve to how they dissipate (University 
                         of Idaho, N.D.).<br><br>

                     <p class="card-text">&emsp;From a simplistic to a complex implementation, queuing can be found everywhere around us,
                         from grocery stores and supermarkets to traffic flow and computer systems. In computing, queues can be found
                          in components such as networks (for example, data packages transmitted over the internet) or processors
                           (for example, how a CPU handles incoming jobs) (Ralston et al., 2000). 
                           Besides utilising queues, computing systems can help researchers analyse queues to solve everyday problems. 
                           Queuing models leveraging computers are also used in traffic control 
                           (University of Idaho, N.D.), healthcare and critical care (Fomundam et al., 2007; McManus et al., 2004) as well as
                            in emergency services (Joseph, 2020).<br><br>

                     <p class="card-text">&emsp;Following a similar approach, our research proposal aims to understand how queues work in other
                         disciplines, how computing can provide value in the utilisation and optimisation of queues, and how queues can be used
                          in humanitarian contexts in complex environments for registration and assistance delivery activities.
                           By answering this subset of questions, we aim to showcase how the widely used concept of queues can use the computing
                            and data analysis disciplines to assist the humanitarian field with the problem of reducing waiting times for
                             populations in perilous situations and apply proper prioritisation by using the technology and computing concepts
                              in a reproducible and usable manner. This technological intervention can potentially assist more than 108 million
                               displaced people worldwide (UNHCR, 2023).<br><br>

                        &emsp;-	Locating a generic topic based on professional and educational experience;<br>
                        &emsp;-	Conducting research on the topic by discussing with subject matter experts but also based on work experience and
                         relevant literature;<br>
                         &emsp;-	Considering 'who is interested in this topic', mainly focusing on academia and international organisations;<br>
                         &emsp;-	Contemplating on the questions that can be asked for the topic, starting from broad questions and making them 
                        more specific along the way, and,<br>
                        &emsp;-	Finally, evaluate the asked question in terms of relevance to the computer field, available literature, 
                        research gap, estimated general interest, clarity and complexity (George Mason University, 2018;

                         to "Queuing Theory in Practice: Employing and Applying Queuing Theory for Humanitarian Registration and Assistance
                          Delivery Activities", which revolves around the central question of "How can the application of queuing theory
                           via computing systems enhance and optimise registration and assistance delivery activities in the humanitarian
                            field". Several other underlying questions exist, such as social consideration regarding the population of
                             concern or ethical consideration and upholding the principle of no harm; those will be partially discussed
                              at a later stage of this presentation (UNHCR, 2019).<br><br>

                         questions raised before. The research aim can be summarized in a few words as "understanding and presenting how queuing
                          works and applies in registration activities". Considering that this is a generic statement, the aim can be
                           further enhanced by diving deeper into the matter at hand. Understanding the role of queues and their importance
                            in humanitarian registration and assistance provision activities is a subject which has yet to be researched in
                             depth, judging by the available literature. Gaining an understanding, researching and presenting how queues work,
                              the different theorems, their applicability in humanitarian registration and assistance provision activities,
                               how they are affected by the specific realm of where they are applied, and the specific needs of the
                                population of concern is one of the primary aims of the dissertation.<br><br>
                                &emsp;Additionally, the research presents several opportunities through which we identify the key objectives:<br><br>
                                &emsp;1.	Explain queuing theory on a high level and how it works in real life by exploring relevant literature;<br>
                                &emsp;2.	Investigate queuing theory usage and applications in relevant disciplines (such as healthcare);<br>
                                &emsp;3.	Explain how registration and assistance delivery activities work in the humanitarian sector and how they
                                 are linked with queuing theory;<br>
                                &emsp;4.	Explore the peculiarity of the queuing theory and its effect on the studied population,
                                 especially in linkage with the psychological situation, their specific needs and their place of habitual
                                  residence (e.g. in refugee camps);<br>
                                &emsp;5.	Determine how queuing theory can be leveraged in the studied context;<br>
                                &emsp;6.	Present examples from subject matter experts in relation to challenges while queuing in the studied
                                 context;<br>
                                &emsp;7.	Apply the findings to develop a reproducible and usable application, either in terms of a
                                 mathematical model or computing artefact;<br>
                                &emsp;8.	Discuss relevant ethical and legal considerations, and,<br>
                                &emsp;9.	Provide concrete and actionable recommendations on how humanitarians can leverage technology
                                 and the expertise of computer scientists to improve queuing conditions and waiting lines.<br><br>

                         analysis. On a high level, the content of qualitative data will be analyzed both in terms of meaning and relevance
                          (direct or indirect), applying a combination of thematic analysis to identify trends and content analysis
                           particularly relevant to the literature review. On a qualitative approach, data (such as basic biodata
                            or queuing metrics) will be cleansed by ensuring no skewing in the underlying patterns,
                             and then business intelligence tools (such as PowerBI) will be used for the presentation part
                              (e.g. charts). In contrast, Python will be used to test queuing algorithms to provide a usable application.<br><br>

                     <p class="card-text">&emsp;Ethical considerations are paramount through the research considering the population of concern.
                         Primary ethical concerns will be identified through relevant literature and professional standards, such as the IASC
                          Code of Conduct (IASC, N.D.), governing humanitarian professionals or the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional
                           Conduct (ACM, 2018). The principle of do not harm (UNHCR, 2019) will be the governing compass on whether something
                            is ethical or not. At the same time, due to the nature of the research, handling ethically sensitive data
                             and avoiding biases (Pannucci & Wilkins, 2010) are also substantial. Moreover, the ethical considerations
                              will be coupled with a relevant risk assessment, focusing on the negative impact of research actions on the
                               population of concern, especially in their legal and physical protection. Risks associated with the disclosure
                                of sensitive information will be at the forefront, and thus, the research should leverage the power of peer 
                                review to ensure that such risks are mitigated. To provide a thorough risk assessment, the toolkit provided
                                 by the University of Essex (University of Essex, N.D.) will be used.<br><br>

                         which should also serve as a stand-alone document, will be the research report, where research questions,
                          data analysis, code writing, and subject-matter expertise will be combined to conclude on actionable recommendations.
                           The annexes will accompany the report and serve as metadata to verify the research methodology and outcomes
                            and enable researchers to develop the research further. Finally, as the application/hands-on deliverable
                             required by the BCS Project Requirements (University of Essex, 2022), we aim to deliver a working
                              application/algorithm, utilising the identified queuing methodology, providing value to humanitarians on

                         where the literature will be collected, reviewed, and assessed in regards to relevance and usability (M1),
                          and resources, such as subject matter experts and relevant data will be identified (M2). From a business intelligence

                            M3 to M6. Considering the need for an application deliverable, this will be developed throughout M5 to M7,
