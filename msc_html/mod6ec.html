      <meta name="description" property="og:description" content="Since a young boy, I had a passion to help people and chose to volunteer in order to support the people of this world, local communities, and the environment. Then studies in Informatics came along the way.
         For quite some time I was wondering “How could I combine both of them?” Then it clicked! Working as a Senior Data Management Assistant at UNHCR made sense. So here I am, fulfilling my two passions by supporting the people that were forced to flee by using my experience in Informatics.">

                        especially during the course of the 21st century and has transformed society in several aspects of everyday life.
                         Tech-industry job postings have grown by 15% between 2021 and 2022, while the general job postings in other
                          fields dropped by 13%, only a few tech-related specialisations present a surplus in skill, and the tech-related
                           investments reached a combined value of 1 trillion US dollars in 2022 (McKinsey, 2023). The so-called AI revolution
                            further draws the picture regarding the advancement of computing technology, with applied AI being considered
                             one of the most innovative technologies (doubling the innovation metrics from 2018 to 2022) with sufficient
                              interest in the global market, increase in the global picture of AI adoption, budget allocation and the relation
                               between cost and revenue of AI applications (McKinsey, 2022).<br><br>

                        &emsp;Similarly to every other revolutionary technology, such as the technologies developed during the three industrial
                         revolutions, computing technology not only brings a plethora of benefits but also raises significant ethical concerns.
                          As an analogy, ethical concerns have also been raised during other Industrial Revolutions, for example,
                           the ethics of craftsmanship concerning the 1st Industrial Revolution (Freeman, 1923) and the unequal
                            distribution of wealth during the 2nd Industrial Revolution (Engelman, N.D.).<br><br>
                        &emsp;Ethics in computing contain a broad spectrum of considerations – from the professional responsibility of 
                        developers and engineers to the societal implications of deploying AI and data technologies, including the different
                         approaches of ethics, such as normative and applied ethics (Stahl et al., 2016). As computing professionals and
                          with the technological tools penetrating everyday life, understanding, evaluating and addressing ethical concerns
                           is paramount to ensure no harm to society.<br><br>
                        &emsp;In this paper, we will address ethical considerations in the form of a case study, assuming that we are 
                        computing professionals conducting data-related work for a company named companyA, which conducts individual 
                        assessments regarding the protection situation of individuals in perilous situations on behalf of humanitarian
                         organisations. The assessments involve individual interviews, personal data and sensitive data collection such
                          as addresses, specific needs and medical conditions, and socioeconomic situation.<br><br>
                        &emsp;Our work involves people at risk, collecting and analysing sensitive information, and is subject to several ethical
                         and legal concerns. At their core, ethics refer to the principle of right and wrong and related choices of
                          individuals that guide their behaviours. Considering the different realms of ethics, the principle of right
                           and wrong can be based on the theory of consequentialism (the ethical value of an action is judged based
                            on its consequences), deontology (the ethical value depends on the intentions of the actor) and virtue ethics
                             (the ethical value depends on the overall character of the actor), among several other theories (Stahl et al., 2016).
                              In our example, the ethical concerns will be judged based on the professional bodies that dictate the code
                               of conduct of computing professionals, related professional practice, and relevant legislation.<br><br>
                        &emsp;Specifically in computing, ethics concentrate on what can potentially harm individuals or communities. 
                        The humanitarian principle of do not harm (UNHCR, 2019) is a generic and not computing-specific principle 
                        that every humanitarian professional should abide by and, considering our specific work, directly applies 
                        to us. In regards to our interviewing exercise, several ethical concerns can be raised, with one of the most
                         important being balancing the equities between the right of the data subject and the overall benefit of the
                          population of concern. For example, during the data collection process, individuals may refuse to answer 
                          specific questions about their specific needs, thus distorting the subsequent analysis. This refusal will
                           skew the analysis results, which, as a consequence, may fail to provide value to the interviewed population. 
                           Although the subsequent actions of the interviewer may be seen as a complex ethical concern, the data subject's
                            right to refuse to answer specific questions or withdraw from research remains irrevocable, according
                             to both professional research practices (Yale, N.D.) and humanitarian practices, which consider consent
                              as an ongoing process (UNHCR, 2018).<br><br>
                        &emsp;Additionally, during the data analysis, we may notice interviewees with severe protection concerns and have
                         the dilemma of taking action to attempt to assist them. Despite this being a natural human reaction, the 
                         individual's data protection should come first, especially considering their situation. Regularly, in protection-related
                          interviews, the interviewees are asked if they would like to receive referrals for services that may assist
                           them with their specific needs. The presence of a social worker during those interviews is also of great 
                           importance, and the data analyst should be aware of their roles, responsibilities and lack of specific training;
                            thus, they should refrain from such actions, which may put individuals in more significant harm. In this instance, 
                            we can directly connect this ethical concern with deontology, where it becomes evident that the actor's intention
                             is not important; instead, the consequences are more significant, as described in consequentialism.<br><br>
                        &emsp;Finally, considering that such research may be psychologically traumatising for the researcher, measures should
                         be put in place to ensure that the researcher does not face any ethical dilemmas regarding altering the spirit
                          of the research outcome, either by overly highlighting the negative aspects of the report to affect decision-making
                           or promote the positive aspects of the report to overly highlight human-suffering (University of Cambridge, N.D.).
                            As mitigation measures, psychosocial support should be available throughout and immediately following the research
                             (Researcher Mental Health Observatory, 2021), ensure that the work is peer-reviewed by a third party (ACM, 2018),
                              and have a sound predefined research methodology (Kelley et al., 2003).<br><br>
                        &emsp;In conclusion, ethics shall be in the main picture of computing and not be considered a secondary duty.
                         With technology continuing to evolve, ethical dilemmas are expected to become more complex, as can also be seen
                          through the increased ethical concerns of every subsequent industrial revolution. Concerning data-related computing
                           ethics and the involvement of people with specific needs in humanitarian contexts, addressing such challenges
                            requires organisations and professionals to think outside of silos, and it needs a collective effort that 
                            involves ethicists, humanitarians, policymakers, computing and data professionals as well as the population 
                            of concern. It is only through dialogue, public consultation, strict oversight and enforcement, professionalism
                             and commitment to upholding the ethical principles that we can ensure that the third and fourth industrial 
                             revolutions will not be overshadowed by harm to society and that humanity will thrive and enjoy the benefits of the
                              innovation and prosperity that computing has to offer.<br><br>
